# ================================================
# Notes for openSUSE:
# ================================================
# 1. Spotify is typically installed via Flatpak:
#    flatpak install flathub com.spotify.Client
#
# 2. Some packages may need to be built from source or installed via:
#    - npm (Node.js packages): spicetify-cli, etc.
#    - pip (Python packages): python311-requests, etc.
#    - AUR equivalents don't apply; use OBS if available
#
# 3. Gaming packages may require additional setup:
#    - Proton/Wine for game compatibility
#    - GPU drivers (nvidia-driver or amdgpu)
#    - Steam runtime libraries
#
# 4. Optional shell plugins should be installed via git:
#    git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/... ~/.local/share/zsh/
#
# 5. Comments marked with # are packages that may not be available
#    in openSUSE repos and should be checked before installation.
